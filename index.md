# Project Pythia

## An education and training hub for the geoscientific Python community

Project Pythia is the education working group for Pangeo and is an educational resource for the entire geoscience community. Together these initiatives are helping geoscientists make sense of huge volumes of numerical scientific data using tools that facilitate open, reproducible science, and building an inclusive community of practice around these goals.

Project Pythia is a home for Python-centered learning resources that are _open-source_, _community-owned_, _geoscience-focused_, and _high-quality_.
